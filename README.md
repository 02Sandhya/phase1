Problem Statement:

The project aims to create a helpful virtual guide using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant. This virtual guide will be customized to assist users on popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack. The chatbot's primary functions include providing useful information, answering frequently asked questions (FAQs), and offering a friendly conversational experience. The overarching goal is to empower users with quick access to information and create meaningful connections through this virtual guide.


Instructions on How to Deploy and Interact with the Chatbot on 
Messaging Platforms

To deploy the chatbot on messaging platforms, you will need to create a 
Watson Assistant account and create a new chatbot. Once you have 
created a chatbot, you can train it on the dataset of user queries and 
responses that are provided in the GitHub repository.
Once the chatbot is trained, you can deploy it to messaging platforms 
such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Telegram. To do this, you will 
need to create a Watson Assistant integration for each messaging 
platform.
To interact with the chatbot on messaging platforms, you can simply 
send it a message. The chatbot will then do its best to answer your 
question or fulfill your request.
